# E-commerce Customer Churn Prediction
## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a leading online e-commerce company. Customer churn is a critical challenge in the e-commerce industry, as retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. By identifying at-risk customers early, the company can implement targeted retention strategies, such as offering personalized promotions or discounts, to improve customer loyalty and reduce churn rates.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains customer information and behaviors, including demographic data, purchase habits, and feedback. Each entry represents a customer with specific features influencing their likelihood of churning. The key features include:

## Features:
* Tenure: The length of time (in months) a customer has been with the company.
* WarehouseToHome: The distance (in kilometers) between the company's warehouse and the customer's home.
* NumberOfDeviceRegistered: The number of devices registered by a particular customer.
* PreferedOrderCat: The preferred order category of a customer in the last month (e.g., Grocery, Electronics, etc.).
* SatisfactionScore: A score indicating the customerâ€™s satisfaction with the service (scale: 1-5).
* MaritalStatus: The marital status of the customer (e.g., Single, Married, Divorced).
* NumberOfAddress: The total number of addresses linked to the customer account.
* Complaint: Whether the customer raised any complaints in the last month (Yes/No).
* DaySinceLastOrder: The number of days since the customer's last order.
* CashbackAmount: The average cashback amount received by the customer in the last month.
* Churn: The target variable indicating whether the customer has churned (1) or not (0).

## Business Context:
The goal of the project is to help the company:

1. Predict which customers are likely to churn.
2. Understand the key factors driving customer churn.
3. Develop actionable strategies to retain high-value customers.
